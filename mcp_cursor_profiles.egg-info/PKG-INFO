# MCP Cursor Profiles Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for managing multiple Cursor IDE profiles across different platforms.

## Features

- 🔄 Switch between Cursor profiles seamlessly
- 📝 Create new profiles from current configuration
- 🏷️ Rename existing profiles
- 📋 List all available profiles
- 🖥️ Cross-platform support (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- 🔒 Safety checks to prevent data corruption

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher (required by MCP package)
- Cursor IDE installed
- An MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager (recommended)

### Method 1: Using uv (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone or download this repository
cd mcp-cursor-profiles

# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
uv sync
```

### Method 2: Using pip

```bash
# Clone or download this repository
cd mcp-cursor-profiles

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

### Option 1: Local Installation with Virtual Environment (Recommended for Development)

After running `uv sync`, use the Python path from your virtual environment in your MCP client configuration:

**Cursor MCP Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cursor-profiles": {
      "command": "/full/path/to/your/project/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["-m", "cursor_profiles_mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Desktop Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cursor-profiles": {
      "command": "/full/path/to/your/project/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["-m", "cursor_profiles_mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Package and Install with uvx (Recommended for Distribution)

To make your server available via `uvx`:

1. **Ensure proper packaging configuration** in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling", "setuptools"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[project]
name = "mcp-cursor-profiles"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "MCP server for managing Cursor profiles"
authors = [
    { name = "Your Name", email = "your.email@example.com" },
]
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.10"
dependencies = [
    "mcp>=1.0.0",
]

[project.scripts]
cursor-profiles-mcp = "cursor_profiles_mcp:main"

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["."]
```

2. **Install in development mode**:
```bash
uv tool install -e .
```

3. **Configure MCP client**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cursor-profiles": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["cursor-profiles-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 3: Direct uvx Run

Run directly with `uvx` without installation:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cursor-profiles": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/full/path/to/your/project", "cursor_profiles_mcp.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 4: Use Entry Point Directly

After running `uv sync`, use the installed script directly:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cursor-profiles": {
      "command": "/full/path/to/your/project/.venv/bin/cursor-profiles-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Finding the Correct Paths

### Get your project path:
```bash
pwd
```

### Get Python path in your virtual environment:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
which python
```

This should give you something like:
`/Users/yourusername/.mcp/mcp-cursor-profiles/.venv/bin/python`

## Recommended Approaches

- **For development**: Use **Option 1** (local virtual environment)
- **For production/distribution**: Use **Option 2** (uvx installation)

Example development configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cursor-profiles": {
      "command": "/Users/yourusername/.mcp/mcp-cursor-profiles/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["-m", "cursor_profiles_mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Available Tools

### `list_profiles`
List all available Cursor profiles with the active profile marked with an asterisk (*).

**Example:**
`list_profiles()`

### `switch_profile`
Switch to a specific profile and open Cursor.

**Parameters:**
- `profile_name` (string): Name of the profile to switch to

**Example:**
`switch_profile("work")`

### `init_profile`
Create a new profile from your current Cursor configuration.

**Parameters:**
- `profile_name` (string): Name for the new profile

**Example:**
`init_profile("personal")`

### `rename_profile`
Rename an existing profile.

**Parameters:**
- `old_name` (string): Current profile name
- `new_name` (string): New profile name

**Example:**
`rename_profile("old", "new")`

### `open_cursor`
Open the Cursor application with the current profile.

**Example:**
`open_cursor()`

## Platform Support

- **macOS**: Uses `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor` paths
- **Windows**: Uses `%APPDATA%/Cursor` paths
- **Linux**: Uses `~/.config/Cursor` paths

## How It Works

The server manages Cursor profiles by:
1. Creating symlinks from the main Cursor directories to profile-specific directories
2. Maintaining two sets of profiles (Application Support and dotfile versions)
3. Ensuring Cursor is closed before profile operations to prevent data corruption
4. Automatically detecting the correct paths for your operating system

## Safety Features

- ✅ Checks if Cursor is running before profile operations
- ✅ Validates profile existence before switching
- ✅ Prevents overwriting existing profiles
- ✅ Maintains symlink integrity

## Troubleshooting

### "Cursor is currently running" error
Quit Cursor completely before using profile management tools.

### "Profile not found" error
Ensure the profile exists using `list_profiles()`.

### Permission errors
Make sure the script has read/write access to Cursor directories.

### MCP connection issues
- Verify the full path to the Python script in your configuration
- Ensure Python is in your system PATH
- Check that all dependencies are installed
- For uvx issues, ensure the package is properly installed with `uv tool install -e .`

### Python version issues
This package requires Python 3.10+. Check your Python version:
```bash
python --version
```

## Development

### Running directly
```bash
python cursor_profiles_mcp.py
```

### Debugging
Set environment variable `MCP_DEBUG=1` for debug output.

### Testing MCP connection
You can test your MCP server configuration by running it directly and checking for any startup errors.

## Key Updates Made:

1. **Updated Python requirement** from 3.8 to 3.10+ throughout the document
2. **Added comprehensive uvx configuration section** with 4 different options
3. **Included specific instructions** for finding correct paths
4. **Added recommended approaches** for different use cases (development vs production)
5. **Enhanced troubleshooting section** with uvx-specific issues
6. **Improved organization** with clear section headers and better flow
7. **Added practical examples** with realistic paths and configurations

This updated README now provides comprehensive guidance for both development setup and distribution using `uvx`, making it much easier for users to configure the MCP server in their Cursor or Claude Desktop applications.
